        <p>
          If you could only own one guitar for the rest of your life, surely it
          would have to be this one: The Fender Stratocaster, a true classic and
          the most popular electric guitar of all time. The Player Series
          Stratocaster shown here is made in Mexico and gives players the most
          affordable way to get their hands on a Strat with the Fender logo on
          the headstock. The guitar's features are anything but budget-level, of
          course, and it combines high-quality woods and hardware with updated
          tone circuits and a fresh and appealing look that includes a one-piece
          maple neck with a matt finish on the back and an alder body, shown
          here in a traditional three-tone sunburst finish.

          <h2 class="info_h2">Judiciously modernised</h2>
          <p>
            The Fender Player Series Stratocaster is the same in many ways as
            the original design that Leo Fender came up with in the early 1950s.
            The neck and fingerboard are made from a single piece of maple, and
            the neck features a modern "C" profile. The fingerboard adds an
            extra fret to the original model's 21, thus providing even more
            freedom for lead playing. As mentioned before, the body is made from
            alder and comes in a high-gloss "Polar White" finish. The classic
            Stratocaster pickup combination of three single coils is also
            present here, but these feature AlNiCo-5 magnets for a more modern
            twist on the bright, dynamic sound for which Stratocasters are
            known. Fender has modified the electronics compared to the original
            Stratocaster design by giving the bridge pickup its own tone
            control, while the second tone control is shared by the middle and
            neck pickups. This model also features a two-point tremolo system,
            which dramatically reduces friction and enhances tuning stability.

          <h2 class="info_h2">An all-rounder AND a specialist</h2>
          <p>
            The Fender Player Series Strat MN PWT is an extremely flexible
            guitar, but its pickup configuration of course means that it
            specialises in some areas more than others. Specifically, this
            guitar is most suited to clean sounds and moderate levels of
            distortion - this is where the pickups really come into their own
            with a punchy, open sound that retains plenty of character and
            fullness within the recommended gain limits. Players of Country,
            Western, Blues, and Classic Rock music can thus be sure of a great
            sound on stage and in the rehearsal room. The Fender Player Series
            of course also includes Strats with pickup combinations more suited
            to heavier musical styles.

          <h2 class="info_h2">About Fender</h2>
          <p>
            Fender is without doubt one of the most legendary guitar and
            amplifier manufacturers of all time. The company was founded in 1946
            by its namesake Leo Fender († 1991), whose innovative ideas brought
            a breath of fresh air into the musical world. His Telecaster,
            Stratocaster, Precision Bass, and Jazz Bass are not only classics –
            they also continue to shape the styles of musicians in countless
            genres to this day. Timeless Fender amplifier models such as the
            Bassman, Twin, Deluxe, and Princeton also enjoy a stellar
            reputation. Besides maintaining its classic product portfolio,
            however, the company is also constantly developing new products that
            make Fender a driving force in today’s music industry.

          <h2 class="info_h2">You won't want to put it down</h2>
          <p>
            Since it was launched by Fender in 1954, the Stratocaster has
            established itself as the ultimate electric guitar and can thus be
            found in virtually every style of music. The Fender Player Series is
            aimed at the mid-price market segment, and the Mexican-made guitars
            combine quality that will satisfy demanding players with an
            affordable price that makes them interesting for beginners as well.
            And even at this price point, they proudly bear the "proper" Fender
            logo. These guitars also offer high resale values, perfect if you
            want to upgrade or if you decide that the guitar isn't the
            instrument for you after all (in which case your Fender definitely
            won't be to blame!).
